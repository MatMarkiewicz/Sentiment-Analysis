## General info
The main goal of this project is to predict the sentiments of sentences. <br>
We work with IMDB movies reviews dataset. Movies are rated from 1 to 10. We consider only the reviews with rating 1 (the worst ones) and 10 (the best ones). <br>
The assumption is that movies with rating 1 have negative sentiment and movies with rating 10 have a positive sentiment. <br>
